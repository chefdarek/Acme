###Part 7 Q&A

What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate when others do the same for your code?
    ANSWER: Improve the code and catch mistakes whilst delivering the feedback in an earnest and respectful way.
    
We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us improve this situation?
    ANSWER: Conatiners ensure the programs services are all running on identical OS/VM images in order to negate dependecy and resproducibility issues.
